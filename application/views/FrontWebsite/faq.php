			<ul>
				<li>An individual does not need to learn all the aspects of FPGA Design flow. Choose one domain and get complete expertise in that topic.</li>

		All courses are offered much lower than in other institutes. Is there any compromise in training quality?
		</a>
	
	<div class="accordion-content">
		
			No, Education should be affordable to the majority of the people. Institute is driven by the ideology of making quality education affordable to everyone. Having said that, all courses are well organized and with industry best trainers covering each course.

			Many FPGA training institutes are offering a course on complete FPGA flow then why does a course focus on just one aspect of an FPGA flow?

		</a>

	<div class="accordion-content">
		
			All the jobs in the FPGA industry at 0 - 7 year experience level do not require expertise in complete FPGA flow. The engineer is not expected to work on complete flow during initial 0 - 7 years of experience. Focus on complete flow does more than help engineers' careers, with reduced focus on a specific aspect. A job aspirant should focus on one aspect to get into the industry while gaining more expertise on the chosen aspect by extensive focus rather than doing courses on complete flow.

			It depends on the student's preparation level. The duration of the preparation will depend on the number of hours spent on focused preparation in a day. For each hour of training, students need to spend two hours of time on self-preparation, and 1 hour revising the session notes, and Labs. 1 hour for practising course assignments and Labs.
